# üéõÔ∏è TX802 Manager
v0.1.0 | 2025-05-09 | Helge T. Kautz

### Design Philosophy
802 Manager was designed for studio use. It treats the TX802 purely as an external sound module and doesn't use any permanent on-device storage or RAM cartridges. Instead, all patch and performance data and the required state handling will be done exclusively via the 802 Manager.
### No MIDI return required
Since the 802 Manager puts the TX802 into a known good init state on application startup, and handles all state changes from there, no MIDI return channel is needed. It is sufficient to connect your computer's MIDI OUT to the TX802's MIDI IN. 
### Difficult things made easy
The new core library tx802_utils.py implements an abstraction layer that that reduces the complexity of the TX802 to simple commands. For example, you can now just switch a Tone Generator (TG) on or off, instead of dealing with Yamaha's archaic 'voice linking' concept."
### Patch Database and Browser
The 802 Manager comes with tens of thousands of patches consolidated from several sources on the internet. Patches with the same name but different sound parameters were kept; patches with different names but identical sound data were excluded. A Patch Browser with filter functionality was implemented. The Patch browser maintains its own audit settings to enable easy patch pre-listening.
### Performance Editor
The heart of the 802 Manager is its Performance Editor, that makes it very easy to layer and split sounds across the TX802‚Äôs 8 Tone Generators The selected settings are saved automatically so that the next time you use the app, the unit will be right back to where you left it.
### Front Panel Control
All tunctions available from the TX802's front panel can be controlled remotely now. Additionally, macro functions that aren't directly available on the front panel were also added, e.g. PRTCT_ON/PRTCT_OFF and RESET.
### Command Line Utilities
Optionally, the 802 Manager includes a number of command line tools with which all functionality of the TX802 can be remotely controlled using easy-to-understand commands (e.g. TG=On, TG=Off, PRESET2=I10, PAN2=Left, PAN3=Right, OUTVOL3=75, etc. The Front Panel can also be controlled from the command line.
### And More
The 802 Manager also includes the new dx7_utils.py library which implements a comprehensive set of patch management functions. It validates SysEx, can extract single patches from banks, create new banks from individual patches, handle the new patch database functions, make "surprise" banks and a lot more.

### üîß Installation
Please make sure git and Python are installed on your system.  It is recommended to use a virtual environment. For example, like this:
> git clone https://github.com/Helge666/802_Manager  
> cd 802_Manager  
> python -m venv .venv  
> .venv\Scripts\activate  
> pip install -r requirements.txt

After installation, start the TX802 Manager GUI with
> python app/main.py

Then open the GUI in e.g. Chrome by clicking on http://localhost:7860


### ‚úÖ Tested With
- Windows 11 Pro
- Python 3.12+
- Gradio 5.25.2+
- Mido 1.3.3+
- python-rtmidi 1.5.8+

The application should also work on Linux and macOS, although this hasn't been tested yet. If you add support, please do so in an OS-agnostic way so the tool remains portable and platform-independent.

### üß™ CLI Test Scenarios
**Tip:** Instead of the GUI, you can use the provided boilerplate scripts from the command line.

Observe the TX802 Panel; it should reflect the changes these scripts are sending.

**Send a complete patch bank (32 patches) to INT1-INT32**  
> python cli/tx802/send_patch_bank.py --bankfile assets/banks/surprise01.syx

**Send only first two patches**  
*(Unofficial workaround, may not correctly work depending on TX802 firmware)*  
> python cli/tx802/send_patch_bank.py --bankfile assets/banks/surprise01.syx --stopafter 2

**Send a single patch to the edit buffer**  
> python cli/tx802/send_single_patch.py --db config/dx_patch_library.sqlite3 --patchid 666

**Send a button macro**  
> python cli/tx802/press_button.py --buttons PERFORM_EDIT,TG8,TEXT="My Test Case"

**Send a performance bank**  
> python cli/tx802/send_perform_bank.py --bankfile banks/Factory_Sysex/TX802_Factory_Performances.syx

**Send performance parameter changes**  
> python cli/tx802/press_button.py --buttons PERFORM_EDIT,TG2  
> python cli/tx802/perform_edit.py --edits OUTVOL1=95,OUTVOL2=98

**Select the first patch in TG1**  
> python cli/tx802/perform_edit.py --edits PRESET1=I01

## ü§ñ A Note on AI Assistance
This project was developed with the help of AI tools, but not through "Vibe Coding". As a veteran coder since before the TX802 even hit the market, I manually wrote code and reviewed the generated parts to the best of my ability. Or, as Inspector Sledge Hammer used to say right when the TX802 was state of the art: "Trust me, I know what I'm doing!"

### üìå TODO
- Commit patch bank to unit on PE tab switch (if uncommitted)
- Add DB selector to Settings
- Use resolve_output_port() consistently.
- Add librarian features (add/save/delete patches and banks)
- Save bank to .syx file in Patch Librarian
- Make rating, category, and comments editable
- Add support for saving performances to syx or DB
- Maybe add a Patch Editor?

## üìö Sources & Acknowledgements
**DX7 Patch Library**  
The `dx_patch_library.sqlite3` database includes curated patches from:

- https://bobbyblues.recup.ch/yamaha_dx7/dx7_patches.html
- https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/d.j.benson/pages/html/dx7.html
- https://www.reddit.com/r/synthesizers/comments/e4jkt7/my_curated_dexeddx7_patches_3_banks/

Patches were deduplicated by their parameter data (not names). Identical-sounding patches with different names were excluded; different-sounding patches with the same name were retained. All meta-information (place of origin, source SysEx file, etc.) is stored alongside the patch in the database.
